This repo explains how to install and work with Kubeflow locally.

##### What is Kubeflow ?

Kubeflow (originated at Google) is an end-to-end Machine Learning (ML) platform for Kubernetes, it provides components for each stage in the ML lifecycle, from exploration through to training and deployment. Operators can choose what is best for their users, there is no requirement to deploy every component.  Kubeflow is the ML toolkit for Kubernetes. The following diagram shows Kubeflow as a platform for arranging the components of your ML system on top of Kubernetes:
